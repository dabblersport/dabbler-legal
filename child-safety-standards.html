<h1>Dabbler – Child Safety Standards</h1>

<p>Dabbler is committed to preventing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and ensuring a safe community for all users. These standards outline our safety practices in compliance with Google Play policies and global regulations.</p>

<h2>1. Zero Tolerance for CSAM</h2>
<p>Dabbler strictly prohibits any form of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Any attempt to upload, distribute, request, or engage with CSAM results in immediate account removal and reporting to law enforcement.</p>

<h2>2. User Reporting Tools</h2>
<p>Users can report harmful content or suspicious behavior directly within the app. Reports are reviewed and actioned promptly.</p>

<h2>3. Enforcement Actions</h2>
<p>Accounts associated with abusive or harmful activity are suspended or permanently banned. Serious cases are referred to authorities.</p>

<h2>4. AI + Human Review</h2>
<p>We use automated detection tools alongside manual review processes to detect and remove harmful content.</p>

<h2>5. Age Restrictions</h2>
<p>Dabbler is intended for adults aged 18 and above. Any underage user accounts are removed immediately upon detection.</p>
